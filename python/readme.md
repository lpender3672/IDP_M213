This code contains a lot of functions developed to automatically find features on the map. However a lot of it was completely scrapped in the final implemetation because they were not able to be verified for robustness.

The majority of this code is my own, however significant references were taken from the OpenCV docs for general usage of the library and the PyImageSearch blog to for detection of markers, as well as the ever important StackOverflow.
